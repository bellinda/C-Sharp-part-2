24/seven

I can feel it in the all
I like the truth but love every dare
Livin' life like it's a vacation
We are golden like the sun
Never never land we all stay young
'Cause we're the here and now generation
Try and knock us down
We'll get up every time
We can run this town
So let's do what we like do what we like

All day every day is a holiday
We're alright 24/Seven
All day every day all we gotta say
Is live your life 24/Seven
Woooooo wooooooo 24/Seven
Woooooo wooooooo 24/Seven
